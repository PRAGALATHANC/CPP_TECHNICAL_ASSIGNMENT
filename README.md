# C++ Developer - Technical Assignment
 
This repository contains my solutions for the C++ Developer Technical Assignment.
 
## Task 1 - Even & Odd Number Printing using Multithreading
Implemented using `std::thread` and synchronization with `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable`.
 
## Task 2 - Encrypted File Storage by Location
- Uses AES-like simple encryption (XOR-based or real library if allowed).
- Saves user input into nested folders like `/Country/State/District/`.
 
## Task 3 - OpenCV Video Capture with Screenshot & Multithreading
- Captures live video using OpenCV.
- Saves video in real-time and handles snapshots with multithreading for smooth operation.
 
### How to Run
Each folder contains instructions and code. Make sure:
- You have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`).
- You have OpenCV set up correctly (for Task 3)
